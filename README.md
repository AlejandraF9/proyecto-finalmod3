# JS Logic Exercises

This project was created as part of Module 3 of the Her-Tech JavaScript Bootcamp using Vite as the development environment.
It includes a collection of 20 logic exercises written in JavaScript to practice conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, strings, and basic algorithms.

## Project Structure:

- Vite: used to make local development faster and easier, with instant updates when saving changes.

- /src: contains the main.js file, which imports all the individual exercise files, allowing each one to be executed and logged to the console independently.

- /algoritmos: Contains a separate JavaScript file for each exercise, keeping the code organized.

## Exercises Included:

1. Odd or Even checker:
   Uses `if/else` and `typeof` to check if a number is even or odd.

2. Reverse a string:
   Uses `split()`, `reverse()` and `join()` to invert a string.

3. Find the largest number:
   Uses `sort()` in descending order to get the first (largest) number.

4. Factorial calculator:
   Uses a `for` loop to multiply values from 1 to `n`.

5. Palindrome validator:
   Compares the original string with its reversed version.

6. Fibonacci sequence:
   Uses a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci number at position `n`.

7. Ascending order without sort:
   Uses a `while` loop and manual comparison to sort an array.

8. Character counter:
   Uses a `for` loop to count matching characters in a string.

9. Leap year checker:
   Uses `if/else` and divisibility rules to determine leap years.

10. Celsius/Fahrenheit converter:
    Applies arithmetic formulas in `if/else` to convert between units.

11. Second largest number:
    Sorts the array and returns the value at index 1.

12. Remove duplicates:
    Uses nested `for` loops and `splice()` to remove repeated values.

13. Sum of array values:
    Uses a `for` loop and accumulator to sum all elements.

14. Anagram validator:
    Sorts and compares the characters of two strings.

15. Prime numbers generator:
    Uses nested loops and flags to identify prime numbers.

16. Roman to arabic converter:
    Uses an object and a loop to convert Roman numerals to integers.

17. Balanced brackets checker:
    Increments or decrements a counter based on `(` and `)`.

18. Leet speak translator:
    Uses an object and a loop to replace letters with leet symbols.

19. Century calculator:
    Uses a `for` loop to count full centuries up to the year.

20. Milliseconds since midnight:
    Multiplies hours, minutes, and seconds to return total milliseconds.

## Technologies Used:

- JavaScript:

  Functions with conditionals, loops, recursion and array methods.

  Type checking using typeof and control structures like if and for.

  String and array manipulation methods.

- Vite:

  Project initialized with Vite for development and fast feedback loop.

- Visual Studio Code:

  Code editor used for development and testing.
